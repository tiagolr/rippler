# Open Beta

This synth is currently under construction and in open beta stage.

If you find it interesting consider submitting presets through on the issues page, I'll be providing licenses to whoever contributes 5 presets or more (provided they are accepted into the factory library).

Other than that, at this stage everything is welcome, sound demos, videos or just plain testing and bug reports.

The licenses to this synth are currently priced at 80€, the beta seems free but it should brick itself three months from build date, still pretty easy to crack I assume that's why I rather keep this under the radar.

Thanks for you time.
